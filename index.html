	<<section id="aboutme">
   My name is Angela Banuelos, Im 15 and I attend school at Pasadena High School as a sophmore. I am the baby out of six kids; three girls and three boys. I have lived all my life in Pasadena with my 5 siblings and both parents. Ever since I was a little girl, Ive been shy, but as Ive gotten older I have learned how to be a little more outgoing. When people ask what I want to be when I grow up, I dont know what to respond but I do know that I'd love to go to Hawaii for college. I hope my dream can come true.
